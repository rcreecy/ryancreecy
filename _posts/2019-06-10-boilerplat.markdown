#### Don't pay too much mind to this post, it's just here to help me make sure stuff is working

I'll be adding real content in the future, I just like developing in production too

{% highlight javascript %}


/**
 * Does a thing
 */
function helloWorld(param1, param2) {
  var something = 0;

  // Do something
  if (2.0 % 2 == something) {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  } else {
    return null;
  }

  // @TODO comment
}


#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
